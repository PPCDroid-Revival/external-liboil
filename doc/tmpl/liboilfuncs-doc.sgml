<para>
Functions operate on arrays of data.  The arrays can be either source
arrays (input only), destination arrays (output only), or in-place
arrays (both input and output).
</para>

<para>
The interpretation of a parameter can usually be determined from its
name.  Parameters for arrays are of the form d1_1xn, where the first
character represents the direction (source, destination, or in-place),
the second represents the index for that particular direction, and
the characters after the underscore indicate the size of the array.
In this case, "1xn" represents an array that is 1 by N.  Note that
the index and the size can both be omitted, giving a default of 1
for the index and 1xn for the size.
</para>

<para>
Parameters that represent strides are of the form "d1s".  The
interpretation is similar to above, except that the s indicates
a stride parameter.
</para>

<para>
The exceptions to the above rule are "dest", "src", "dstr", "sstr", etc.
These are aliases for "d1", "s1", "d1s", and "s1s", respectively.  This
form is deprecated and will be removed in the 0.4 series.
</para>

<para>
Two special parameters are "n" and "m", which determine the size of
the arrays in other parameters.
</para>

<para>
Data arrays are laid out such that rows are separated by the number
of bytes given by the corresponding stride.  Elements in each row
are contiguous.  If there is no stride parameter corresponding to an
array, the rows of the array are contiguous.
