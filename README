Ideas:

implementations should be flagged as to whether or not they contain
assembly, and also whether or not they are the product of the
alternate optimization.  This way, testing code can automatically
flag functions where the alternate optimization is faster than the
C or asm code, indicating that the compiler output should be turned
into assembly.



Why is trans8x8_f64 so slow on powerpc (compared to trans8x8_u16)?
